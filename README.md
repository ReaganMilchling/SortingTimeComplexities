# PythonSortingComplexities
A small part of one of one homework from my Algorithms class. 

This file visualizes three different sorting algorithm implementations. Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion sort. 
The algorithms are based off [Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) and they are not meant to be perfectly optimal, as this is a purely academic exercise.
